// Relationship betweeen the "product" and "product_category" entities
In a database diagram, the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities likely represent tables in a relational database. 
The relationship between them is likely a foreign key relationship.
Each "Product" entry in the database table probably has a foreign key that refers to the primary key of the "Product_Category" table. 
This establishes a connection between individual products and their corresponding categories.
In other words, it allows you to link a product to its specific category,
providing a structured way to organize and retrieve information about products within different categories.

// assigning of a valid category to each product in a product table

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it you can use a foreign key constraint.
The foreign key in the "Product" table would reference the primary key in the "Product_Category" table.
This constraint enforces referential integrity, meaning that every value in the foreign key column of 
the "Product" table must match a primary key value in the "Product_Category" table.
In practical terms, this ensures that you cannot insert a product into the "Product" table with a category
that does not exist in the "Product_Category" table. It helps maintain data consistency and prevents orphaned records.
